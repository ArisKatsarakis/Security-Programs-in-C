Strace results of ssh are:
--Comand         
    in .bashrc alias test
strace -o trace.txt ssh milo.csd.uoc.gr
--Data in trace.txt
Ssh syscalls for password authentication

writes in /dev/tty 
and using ioctl() and the signal that gets back from /dev/tty to login 
or not in the terminal procces

-- strace ioctl checks if /dev/tty with sig_raction 
-- the password is read by syscall read and fd = 4 
-- if we open ssh with read and print the data in a text 
strace -f -e read -o read.txt ssh destination 
we get everything that the ssh commands reads

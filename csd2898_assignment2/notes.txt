-- Bash Scripting
--- Injection in .bashrc
    
-- my_ssh.sh <destination> 
-- monitoring with strace 
-- Filter and parse monitored syscals and find which contains the pass
-- Store Password
-- Scripting Basics
Strace results of ssh are:
--Comand         
    in .bashrc alias test
strace -o trace.txt ssh milo.csd.uoc.gr
--Data in trace.txt
Ssh syscalls for password authentication

writes in /dev/tty 
and using ioctl() and the signal that gets back from /dev/tty to login 
or not in the terminal procces

-- strace ioctl checks if /dev/tty with sig_raction 
-- the password is read by syscall read and fd = 4 
-- if we open ssh with read and print the data in a text 
strace -f -e read -o read.txt ssh destination 
we get everything that the ssh commands reads

- pcap_loop() returns the packet that is the first poitnter to the header
we need to define a hader through struct sniff_ip
